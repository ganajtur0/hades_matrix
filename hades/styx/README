The HADES waveform viewer.

The main class, WaveformViewer, provides both the public interface
methods and the GUI for the waveform viewer. It support zooming and
scrolling, and several search functions (still many bugs here).
NameCanvas, TimePanel, Transformation, WaveCanvas, Xscroller, and
Yscroller are used for the user interface. 

A single waveform is represented by either the base class Waveform 
or a specialized subclass for a specific Signal type. The subclasses 
usually provide additional functionality, e.g. to manage and display 
StdLogic1164 values with the same colors as used by Hades glow mode.
Currently, this package supports the following singal types:

StdLogic1164    SignalStdLogic1164     WaveStdLogic1164
StdLogicVector  SignalStdLogicVector   WaveStdLogicVector
String          SignalString           WaveString
Integer         SignalInteger          WaveInteger

Adding new signal types requires a corresponding subclass and
a change to the addSignal() method in WaveformViewer. This should
really use a 'WaveFactory' instead. You should also provide
support for object serialization in new Waveform subclasses.

For (so far, unfinished) documentation about the code, see the 
Bsc. thesis from Marcus Carl in the /hades/doc/theses/ directory.
The package name "styx" is taken from Greek mythology :-)
