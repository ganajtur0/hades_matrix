[description]
read-only memory for the D*CORE processor.

Memory size, access time, and initialization file can be specified 
via the configuration dialog which also includes the interactive
memory editor. Unlike the standard RTLIB ROM, DcoreROM includes 
the option to switch the memory editor display between the usual
"hex" mode and a "disassembly" mode.

Inputs and outputs are of types StdLogicVector and StdLogic1164.
Use the configuration dialog to specify the delay of the component
and the bit-width of the data buses.(The default bus width is n=16
and the maximum width is n=63. The bus width can only be changed
while no signals are connected to the RTLIB component.)

Note that simulation performance may be limited by GUI updates due
to glow-mode and RTLIB-animation (e.g. labels on flipflops or Opins).
If necessary, switch off glow-mode and RTLIB-animation via the 'view'
menu. With RTLIB-animation off, however, component symbols won't be
updated and may not match the actual value on the component/signal.
Select a manual redraw after pausing the simulation to update the GUI.
