# /hades/models/pic/help/about.txt

A simulation model for the PIC16C84 and PIC16F84 microcontrollers
for the HADES simulation framework. For information about HADES,
see tech-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades.

The PIC family of 8-bit microcontrollers is designed and fabricated
by Arizona Microchip. See www.microchip.com for product information
and datasheets.

Besides modeling the full instruction set and RT-level behaviour
of the 16C84/16F84 processors, the simulation models include all
peripheral components of the real processors:

  - 16C8x instruction set 
  - PIC 16C84 or 16F84 register file memory map
  - program memory disassembly

  - PORTA   input/output port 
  - PORTB   input/output port 
  - TMR0    timer module with prescaling
  - WDT     watchdog timer with prescaling
  - EEPROM  data memory 

The Pic16C84.class and Pic16F84.class models are cycle-accurate
and require an external clock source, while the FastPic16F84 
uses an internal clock and includes performance optimizations which
may incur timing inaccuracies of up to 1 instruction cycle time
with respect to signal changes on port A and port B.
