To set or remove a breakpoint at some PIC 16C84/16F84 instruction, 
use the memory disassembler GUI component (located at the right
of the PIC property editor window).

First, scroll the disassembler window to make the target address
visible. Then, simply click the mouse in the 'address field' 
(on the left of the disassembler window) at the target address
to toggle the breakpoint status of that address. 

If a breakpoint is active at some address, the corresponding row
in the disassembler view will start with "* " and will be displayed
in red color. Normal instructions without breakpoint start with 
a ". " string and are displayed in black color.


If the opcode part of one row of the disassembler view is displayed
in blue color, that address is selected for editing. Just type in
the desired opcode to change the program memory contents for that
address, or type <ESC> or <ENTER> to finish editing.

To summarize the display options:

<black color>     normal instruction, no breakpoint, no editing

<red color>       breakpoint active at that address

<blue color>      address selected for memory editing, 
                  just type in the desired opcode, 
                  e.g. "2805" for the "goto 0x005" instruction
