To edit the memory contents of the PIC16C84 or PIC16F84 
microcontroller, do the following:


For the PIC program memory:

  Click the mouse at the target address, to select that
  address for editing. If necessary, scroll the memory
  disassembler view, to make the target address visible.
  The selected instruction will be displayed in blue 
  color.

  Afterwards, just type in the desired memory contents,
  i.e., the PIC instruction at the target address.
  For example, scroll to address 0x000, click there,
  then type in "2805" to specify a "goto 0x005" instruction.
  Press the <enter> or <return> key to store the memory data.



For the PIC data, eeprom, and stack memories:

  Click the mouse at the target address, to select that
  address for editing. As no scrollbars are displayed
  for the data, eeprom, or stack memories, just use the
  <cursor up/down> or <page up/down> keys to make the 
  target address visible. Use the <home> and <end> keys
  to move to the first or last address of the memory.

  Afterwards, just type in the desired memory contents,
  e.g. type in "ef" to set the memory at the selected
  address to the (Hex) value of "0xef".

  You can also hold down the <shift> key and use the
  <cursor up/down> keys to increment/decrement the
  memory data at the target address.

  Note that all your changes are instantly stored to
  the corresponding memory address.


For the PIC W/PC/STATUS/INTCON registers:

  Just type in the desired value, then type <enter>
  or <return>.



Naturally, you may want to pause the simulation during manual
editing, in order to inhibit concurrent changes to the edited
memory cells from the running program.
