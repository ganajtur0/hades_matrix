Here, again, are the steps to program real PICs (16C84) with the 
low-cost serial programmer and the PIP-02 program: 

0) WARNING: these DOS programs will crash if your computer is too fast,
   due to an old and annoying bug in the TurboPascal runtime library. 
   The typical symptom is a runtime error 200.

   There is nothing you can do, except using a slower (<200 MHz) computer,
   or using the excellent WinPIC programmer instead of the DOS-mode 
   programs. Visit http://people.freenet.de/dl4yhf/winpicpr.html

1) Connect the serial programmer hardware to a serial port on your PC.

2) Open a DOS-box. 

3) Run the com84.exe program and specify the serial port to use:

   COM84 COM2
   COM84 COM<x>
   COM84 REMOVE

4) Run the pip-02.exe program to read, program, and verify the PIC processor

   PIP-02

5) From within PIP-02, load the '.hex' file to load into the PIC,
   check the fuse settings, then select program, finally verify.
