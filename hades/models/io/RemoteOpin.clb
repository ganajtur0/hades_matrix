[description]
RemoteOpin - transfer input events to a remote server using
a simple URL protocol encoding and generate a trigger pulse.
Default bit-width is N=24.

This simulation model waits for input events on its N data inputs,
encodes the input values into a simple text-only URL representation,
and contacts the server specified by "urlBase".
In combination with a corresponding server (cgi-script or servlet),
this allows to access remote simulation models from a standard
Hades simulation setup.

To improve efficiency and to reduce network load, multiple
events occuring at the same time are encoded as a single output
value change. Internally, this is realized using a Wakeup-Event.

Also, a short 1nsec. pulse is generated on the "trigger" output pin
for each network transaction. One use of this trigger pulse is to 
activate a RemoteIpin component to sample the remote circuit's response.
