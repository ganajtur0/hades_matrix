[description]
n-bit positive edge-triggered D-type or shift register.

When ENA=0, the register behaves as a normal D-type register.
When ENA=1, the register contents is shifted right on the 
positive edge of the clock input, while the leftmost bit
(most significand bit) is set from the SIN input.

Inputs and outputs are of types StdLogicVector and StdLogic1164.
Use the configuration dialog to specify the delay of the component
and the bit-width of the data buses.(The default bus width is n=16
and the maximum width is n=63. The bus width can only be changed
while no signals are connected to the RTLIB component.)

Note that simulation performance may be limited by GUI updates due
to glow-mode and RTLIB-animation (e.g. labels on flipflops or Opins).
If necessary, switch off glow-mode and RTLIB-animation via the 'view'
menu. With RTLIB-animation off, however, component symbols won't be
updated and may not match the actual value on the component/signal.
Select a manual redraw after pausing the simulation to update the GUI.
