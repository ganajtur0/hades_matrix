[description]
n-bit test for equality

  y  <=  (A == B)

Inputs and outputs are of types StdLogicVector and StdLogic1164.
Use the configuration dialog to specify the delay of the component
and the bit-width of the data buses.(The default bus width is n=16
and the maximum width is n=63. The bus width can only be changed
while no signals are connected to the RTLIB component.)
