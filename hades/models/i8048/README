The source code and classes in this directory are relicts of
a first attempt to model a microcontroller for Hades Cosimulation
experiments. This was given up when we decided to use the PIC 16
family instead.

The files include an opcode table, first support for the basic 
fetch/decode/execute instruction cycle, and some GUI stuff 
for the Intel 8048 microcontroller.
Note that all of the sources are incomplete and would need a lot
of additional work to get the controller up and running.
