HADES MemoryEditor key mapping:

Currently, the following keys are used in the MemoryEditor:

0 .. 9               enter the hexadecimal digit 0 .. F at the
a .. f               current cursor position
A .. F 
                     Note that the data is scrolled after the
                     cursor reaches the rightmost position of the
                     current data element. This allows you to 
                     quickly enter or correct data just by typing
                     it again.

space                move the cursor to the next data element,
                     i.e. at the next address

<shift>+space        move the cursor to the previous data element

cursor-up            move the cursor
cursor-down
cursor-left
cursor-right

<shift>+cursor-up    increment the data at the cursor position
<shift>+cursor-down  decrement the data at the cursor position
                     Note: these keys allow you to easily count
                     through a set of values

<shift>+I            insert empty memory word at current cursor
                     position (shifts down the remaining words)

                     Note: page-up and page-d-1own are not supported by
                     all memory editors.
page-up              move one screen up
page-down            move one screen down

home                 first screen (addr=0)
end                  last screen (addr=size-1)
