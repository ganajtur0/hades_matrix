% some things still to be done for Hades:

#1
  make DesignManager more forgiving against "wrong" CLASSPATH
  settings. In every case, allow to access local files, whether they
  are in CLASSPATH or not.

#2
  provide better stimuli input for both batch and interactive simulation.
  This should be realized using Java classes, to allow users to run
  batch mode simulation without Jython installed.
  
#3
  finally, finally, finally
  implement select/move/copy/delete region


* implement jfig linewidth 0 object rendering

* go through the basic examples and add Labels/"frills" 
  where appropriate

* make the BrowserFrame (DesignManager frontend) accessible
  from the "normal" Editor GUI: e.g. via an additional menu item
  "browse" in the Editor popup menu.

* make "simulation run for" restartable (=fix simulator livelock bug)

* add a new SimObject used to specify simulation stimuli, 
  especially in a easy-to-write text format (like Cadence STL),
  e.g. hades.models.meta.Stimulus


* change hades.models.mips.* to use
  1) InputStream instead of File where possible
  2) IDT3051 to write resource information to the .hds file,
     including ELF/ECOFF files and memory management setup
  3) use NameMangler to encode/decode file/resource names

* write additional MIPS IDT3051 tests, starting with programs
  for basic arithmetic, logic, branch instruction,
  going to MMU/Cache initialization,
  ending with exceptions.

* write some "real application" tests, like mobile-phone display,
  answering machine, game-of-life, ...

* improve usability of hades.models.meta.ActionButton,
  this might include a full rewrite...

* add some examples / demos for the hades.models.meta.AudioPlayer
  

* add testsuite stuff to check and re-check the simulator
  start/stop/pause/run for/interactive event functionality

* add testcases with simple simulation examples for all basic
  gates, complexgates, flipflops, TTLs, special- and meta-models,
  and the full RTLIB

* add testcases for the ISCAS/EDIFIN/VHDLOUT converters
