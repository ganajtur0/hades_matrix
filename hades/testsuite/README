% /hades/testsuite/README, 22.08.2001

This is the base directory for the Hades testsuite, which is meant to
torture several aspects of the framework including the user interface.
While the testsuite is intended to test all Hades classes and scripts,
it is currently very incomplete. More tests will be added as time allows.

For ease of writing, most tests here are be written as Jython scripts, 
and as such require that JPython or Jython are installed on the host
system. At the very least, you will need a working Java virtual machine
and both the hades.jar and jython.jar (jpython.jar) classes to run the
testsuite. Set up your CLASSPATH correspondingly, then run

jython runAllTests.py

and check the resulting status in the "hades.log" file.

The user interface tests use the java.awt.Robot class, which may require 
additional privileges and software to run on some systems. For example,
on X-Windows the XTest server extension is needed.

Here is a short overview of the testsuite directory tree:
